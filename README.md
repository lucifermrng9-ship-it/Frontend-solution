### What I learned
Through this project,  have improved my understanding of html structure, CSS layout and basic styling techniques. I have also gained more practice organising files and linking html with external CSS.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="frontend.css">
```
```css
@media (max-width: 400px) {
    .container {
        width: 90%;
        padding: 15px;
    }

    .container h1 {
        font-size: 1.2rem;
    }

    .container p {
        font-size: 0.9rem;
    }
}

### Continued development
In future iterations, I would improve responsiveness, refine the layout, and enhance the overall visual consistency of the page.
